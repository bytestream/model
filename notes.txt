form tweaks:
Thanks for moving this to a public port, Lowell. Based on Chuck's request,
I do have a couple suggestions for making the form more easily
customizable. While it may seem like overkill, I find the best bet is to
follow this pattern:
<div>
<div><label></label></div>
<div><input /></div>
</div>

The reason I prefer to do this is that it negates the need for <br> tags
since divs are block-level elements (using the br tag is technically
considered a non-semantic tag, and therefore bad practice). It also allows
you, through a stylesheet, to control whether or not the labels are above
the fields or to the side, just by adding classnames to the containing
divs.

A couple of other suggestions: the label tags should have a "for"
attribute that matches the id value of the input they're referring to. This
is for accessibility reasons, and helps aid in tab indexing for
keyboard-oriented users. While we're talking about labels, it might be a
good idea to remove the colon after each label. It's better to group
related fields with white-space, and actually makes the form look less
complicated, believe it or not.

Also, since the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 spec, the "name" attribute has
been replaced by the "id" attribute. You can safely remove the "name"
attribute from your form inputs and use "id" instead, which will allow for
compatibility with either doctype in any A-Grade browsers.
